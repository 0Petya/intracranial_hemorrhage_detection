The aim is to extract information in an affective and efficient manner for improved clinical diagnosis. The recent advances in the field of biomedical engineering have made medical image analysis one of the top research and development area. One of the reasons for this advancement is the application of machine learning techniques for the analysis of medical images. Deep learning is successfully used as a tool for machine learning, where a neural network is capable of automatically learning features. This is in contrast to those methods where traditionally hand crafted features are used. The selection and calculation of these features is a challenging task. Among deep learning techniques, deep convolutional networks are actively used for the purpose of medical image analysis. This includes application areas such as segmentation, abnormality detection, disease classification, computer aided diagnosis and retrieval. In this study, a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in medical image analysis using deep convolutional networks is presented. The challenges and potential of these techniques are also highlighted.}, number={11}, journal={Journal of Medical Systems}, author={Anwar, Syed Muhammad and Majid, Muhammad and Qayyum, Adnan and Awais, Muhammad and Alnowami, Majdi and Khan, Muhammad Khurram}, year={2018}, month={Oct}, pages={226} }

   @article{Ebinger, title={Effect of the use of ambulance-based thrombolysis on time to thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke: a randomized clinical trial}, volume={311}, DOI={10.1001/jama.2014.2850}, abstractNote={IMPORTANCE: Time to thrombolysis is crucial for outcome in acute ischemic stroke.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if starting thrombolysis in a specialized ambulance reduces delays.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In the Prehospital Acute Neurological Treatment and Optimization of Medical care in Stroke Study (PHANTOM-S), conducted in Berlin, Germany, we randomly assigned weeks with and without availability of the Stroke Emergency Mobile (STEMO) from May 1, 2011, to January 31, 2013. Berlin has an established stroke care infrastructure with 14 stroke units. We included 6182 adult patients (STEMO weeks: 44.3% male, mean [SD] age, 73.9 [15.0] y; control weeks: 45.2% male, mean [SD] age, 74.3 [14.9] y) for whom a stroke dispatch was activated.
INTERVENTIONS: The intervention comprised an ambulance (STEMO) equipped with a CT scanner, point-of-care laboratory, and telemedicine connection; a stroke identification algorithm at dispatcher level; and a prehospital stroke team. Thrombolysis was started before transport to hospital if ischemic stroke was confirmed and contraindications excluded.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was alarm-to-thrombolysis time. Secondary outcomes included thrombolysis rate, secondary intracerebral hemorrhage after thrombolysis, and 7-day mortality.
RESULTS: Time reduction was assessed in all patients with a stroke dispatch from the entire catchment area in STEMO weeks (3213 patients) vs control weeks (2969 patients) and in patients in whom STEMO was available and deployed (1804 patients) vs control weeks (2969 patients). Compared with thrombolysis during control weeks, there was a reduction of 15 minutes (95% CI, 11-19) in alarm-to-treatment times in the catchment area during STEMO weeks (76.3 min; 95% CI, 73.2-79.3 vs 61.4 min; 95% CI, 58.7-64.0; P < .001). Among patients for whom STEMO was deployed, mean alarm-to-treatment time (51.8 min; 95% CI, 49.0-54.6) was shorter by 25 minutes (95% CI, 20-29; P < .001) than during control weeks. Thrombolysis rates in ischemic stroke were 29% (310/1070) during STEMO weeks and 33% (200/614) after STEMO deployment vs 21% (220/1041) during control weeks (differences, 8%; 95% CI, 4%-12%; P < .001, and 12%, 95% CI, 7%-16%; P < .001, respectively). STEMO deployment incurred no increased risk for intracerebral hemorrhage (STEMO deployment: 7/200; conventional care: 22/323; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.42, 95% CI, 0.18-1.03; P = .06) or 7-day mortality (9/199 vs 15/323; adjusted OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.31-1.82; P = .53).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with usual care, the use of ambulance-based thrombolysis resulted in decreased time to treatment without an increase in adverse events. Further studies are needed to assess the effects on clinical outcomes.

However, studies have found that less than 30% of US patients are treated within this time window.
TARGET: Stroke was designed as a national quality improvement initiative to improve DTN times for tPA administration in patients with AIS.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate DTN times for tPA administration and the proportion of patients with times of 60 minutes or less before and after initiation of a quality improvement initiative and to determine whether potential improvements in DTN times were associated with improvements in clinical outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The
TARGET: Stroke initiative disseminated 10 care strategies to achieve faster DTN times for tPA administration, provided clinical decision support tools, facilitated hospital participation, and encouraged sharing of best practices. This study included 71,169 patients with AIS treated with tPA (27,319 during the preintervention period from April 2003-December 2009 and 43,850 during the postintervention period from January 2010-September 2013) from 1030 Get With The Guidelines-Stroke participating hospitals (52.8% of total).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The DTN times for tPA administration of 60 minutes or less and in-hospital risk-adjusted mortality, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, ambulatory status at discharge, and discharge destination.
RESULTS: Median DTN time for tPA administration declined from 77 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 60-98 minutes) during the preintervention period to 67 minutes (IQR, 51-87 minutes) during the postintervention period (P < .001). The DTN times for tPA administration of 60 minutes or less increased from 26.5% (95% CI, 26.0%-27.1%) of patients during the preintervention period to 41.3% (95% CI, 40.8%-41.7%) during the postintervention period (P < .001). The DTN times of 60 minutes or less increased from 29.6% (95% CI, 27.8%-31.5%) of patients in the quarter immediately before the intervention (fourth quarter of 2009) to 53.3% (95% CI, 51.5%-55.2%) in the final postintervention quarter (third quarter of 2013) (P < .001). The annual rate of improvement in DTN times of 60 minutes or less increased from 1.36% (95% CI, 1.04%-1.67%) per year preintervention to 6.20% (95% CI, 5.58%-6.78%) per year postintervention (P < .001). In-hospital all-cause mortality improved significantly from the preintervention to the postintervention period (9.93% vs 8.25%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.89 [95% CI, 0.83-0.94], P < .001), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours was less likely to occur (5.68% vs 4.68%; adjusted OR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.76-0.91], P < .001), and discharge to home was more frequent (37.6% vs 42.7%; adjusted OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.09-1.19], P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Implementation of a national quality improvement initiative was associated with improved timeliness of tPA administration following AIS on a national scale, and this improvement was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and intracranial hemorrhage, along with an increase in the percentage of patients discharged home.}, number={16}, journal={JAMA}, author={Fonarow, Gregg C. and Zhao, Xin and Smith, Eric E. and Saver, Jeffrey L. and Reeves, Mathew J. and Bhatt, Deepak L. and Xian, Ying and Hernandez, Adrian F. and Peterson, Eric D. and Schwamm, Lee H.}, year={2014}, month={Apr}, pages={1632–1640} }

   @article{Strbian, title={Ultraearly thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke is associated with better outcome and lower mortality}, volume={41}, DOI={10.1161/STROKEAHA.109.571976}, abstractNote={BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pooled analysis of major placebo-controlled trials suggests that the earlier thrombolysis is given after ischemic stroke, the better the outcome. We report a single-center assessment of the effect of ultraearly thrombolysis on the outcome of our patients.
METHODS: Between January 2003, and December 2008, a total of 878 patients with ischemic stroke received thrombolysis within 4.5 hours from the symptom onset at the Helsinki University Central Hospital. Using univariate methods and multivariable logistic regression, we assessed the association between onset-to-treatment time (OTT) and favorable 3-month outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2).
RESULTS: Median age was 70.5 years, median OTT 115 minutes, and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on admission 9. After adjustment for baseline stroke severity, more patients with OTT <70 minutes had a favorable outcome than those with OTT > or = 70 minutes. Specifically, OR of 5.15 (1.50 to 27.5) was for the patients with NIHSS 7 to 12, and 2.74 (1.26 to 5.90) for those with NIHSS > or = 13. Of the patients with OTT < or = 90 minutes, those with NIHSS 7 to 12 had an OR of 1.72 (1.00 to 2.96) for a favorable outcome, and those with NIHSS > or = 13 had lower mortality than the ones with OTT >90 minutes (16.4% versus 29.5%; P=0.01). Multivariable model showed an association of better outcome with lower baseline glucose level, younger age, lower baseline NIHSS, and OTT <70 minutes.
CONCLUSIONS: Ultraearly thrombolysis was associated with better outcome of our patients with stroke with moderate or severe symptoms. The earlier the treatment was given, the higher the likelihood of favorable outcome.}, number={4}, journal={Stroke}, author={Strbian, Daniel and Soinne, Lauri and Sairanen, Tiina and Häppölä, Olli and Lindsberg, Perttu J. and Tatlisumak, Turgut and Kaste, Markku and Helsinki Stroke Thrombolysis Registry Group}, year={2010}, month={Apr}, pages={712–716} }
